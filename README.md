# PS5 WebKit Autoloader for ESP32

This turns a cheap ESP32 board into a Wi-Fi hotspot. You plug the board into the PS5, join that hotspot, and open the official **User’s Guide**. The guide loads a page from the board (not from the internet). That page installs [itsPLK/ps5-webkit-autoloader](https://github.com/itsPLK/ps5-webkit-autoloader). After that, **Media → WebKit Autoloader** starts Payload Manager.

Use it on a console you own. Homebrew and WebKit exploits can violate Sony’s terms. The console or the PSN account can be banned if that console goes online. This project does not hide you from Sony.

| Exploit | PS5 system software |
| --- | --- |
| poops | 7.00–12.00 |
| relapse | 7.00–13.60 except 9.05 |

If both work on your version, poops is the one that runs.

## What you need

- A PS5 on one of the versions above
- An ESP32 board with a USB port: **ESP32-S2 Mini** (TENSTAR and similar), ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3, or ESP32-PICO
- A USB cable that carries data, not charge-only
- Chrome or Edge on a PC to write the firmware (Firefox and Safari cannot)

## Write the firmware (one time)

The board ships empty. You write our image onto it from a PC. After that you move the board to the PS5.

### Web flasher

1. Open the [web flasher](https://percdotdev.github.io/ps5-webkit-autoloader-esp32/) in Chrome or Edge.
2. Pick the chip that matches the metal shield on the board. A TENSTAR ESP32-S2 Mini is **ESP32-S2**.
3. Unplug the board. Hold the **BOOT** button, plug it into the PC, wait two seconds, then let go. That is download mode. Without it the chip ignores the write.
4. Select the port (a COM port, or “USB JTAG/serial debug unit”) and write. Leave the tab open.

When the write finishes the board may vanish from Windows. That is normal. These images turn off native USB after boot so the PS5 does not fight the serial port.

You can also download a [release](https://github.com/percdotdev/ps5-webkit-autoloader-esp32/releases/latest) and write the matching `.merged.bin` at address `0x0` with esptool. The same payload version updates the `latest` release in place. A new payload version gets its own release.

| Board | File | On-board LED |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ESP32-S2 | `esp32-arduino.s2.merged.bin` | GPIO 15 |
| ESP32-S3 | `esp32-arduino.s3.merged.bin` | GPIO 21 |
| ESP32-PICO | `esp32-arduino.pico.merged.bin` | GPIO 10 |
| ESP32-C3 | `esp32-arduino.c3.merged.bin` | GPIO 8 |

The LED stays on while the board boots, then does a short blink every couple of seconds when the hotspot is up. It flashes on each page request. Fast blinking means the Wi-Fi hotspot failed to start.

## Use it on the PS5

1. Unplug the board from the PC and plug it into a USB port on the PS5. Leave it there.
2. On the PS5: **Settings → Network → Settings → Set Up Internet Connection**. Join Wi-Fi **`ESP32_PORTAL`**, password **`12345678`**.
3. Stay on that network. The PS5 will say there is no internet. That is expected. There is no internet, and none is required.
4. **Settings → Guide and Tips → User’s Guide**. Wait until the page finishes loading. The first time this caches the files onto the console.
5. Payload Manager should open. A **WebKit Autoloader** shortcut appears under **Media**.

Next time you only need the board plugged in, Wi-Fi still on `ESP32_PORTAL`, then **Media → WebKit Autoloader**.

Relapse needs the IP the board hands out (the PS5 must stay on `ESP32_PORTAL`). Poops does not need a network interface.

## Check the install

The board serves two diagnostic pages while you are on `ESP32_PORTAL`. The installer links both from the exploit picker, and the flasher links the same pages from its troubleshooting panel.

- `http://192.168.4.1/status.html` shows the payload version, board, free LittleFS, uptime, the last chain the console requested and the last request that failed. The raw data is at `/status.json`.
- `http://192.168.4.1/selftest.html` fetches `__complete__`, both chain pages, the three payload binaries and both AppCache manifests, then reports what is missing.

The web flasher verifies the write with the chip's own MD5 command and shows the digest in the log. It also compares the bundled payload with the latest [itsPLK release](https://github.com/itsPLK/ps5-webkit-autoloader/releases) and says when a newer payload is available.

## Build from source

```sh
./install-deps.sh
python3 pack/pack_payload.py --web /path/to/ps5-webkit-autoloader
make
```

Arduino-ESP32 **2.0.11** only. Images land in `build/{pico,s2,s3,c3}/`. `make debug` / `make debug-s2` keeps USB serial so you can read logs.
